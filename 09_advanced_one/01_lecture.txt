---- What is an API ----
- API stands for Application Programming Interface.
- It is a set of rules and tools that allows one piece of software to communicate with another.

Example : 
1. https://api.github.com/users/user-name
2. https://randomuser.me/api
3. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Formatter : JSON Formatter (https://jsonformatter.org/)

# What is XMLHttpRequest?
-------------------------
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is a built-in JavaScript object that allows you to:

- Send HTTP or HTTPS requests to a server,
- Receive responses without refreshing the page,
- Communicate with APIs, load data, submit forms, and more â€” all asynchronously.

It was introduced in the early 2000s, and was the core technology behind AJAX, which enabled dynamic, interactive web pages.

Misconception:-
--------------
Despite the name, XMLHttpRequest can handle any data format, not just XML. JSON is more commonly used today.

Why use it (historically)?
--------------------------
Before modern tools like fetch() and axios, XHR was the only way in JavaScript to send/receive data without reloading the web page.
