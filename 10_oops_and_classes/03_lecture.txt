 What is prototype in JS ?
 -------------------------
 In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called [[Prototype]] (also accessible via .prototype or __proto__) which points to another object. 
 This object acts as a blueprint or fallback for properties and methods.

âœ… It's the foundation of inheritance in JavaScript.

ðŸ”¸ Why does prototype exist?
----------------------------
JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance instead of class-based inheritance (like Java or C++).

When you try to access a property or method:
1. JS first checks the object itself.
2. If not found, it walks up the prototype chain to find it.
